## Dependencies
The linear complementarity Problems (LCPs) generated by this library are solved using [http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ferris/path.html](PATH). 

The bilinear matrix inequalities are solved using http://www.penopt.com/penbmi.html (PenBMI). Please contact the creators in order to obtain the license.

Optimization problem is formulated using  https://yalmip.github.io/ (YALMIP).

`pathlcp`, `PenBMI`, `pathlcp` will need to be in the MATLAB path for the examples to run correctly.
